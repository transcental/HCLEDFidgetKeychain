# Hack Club LED Fidget Keychain

![3d Model](imgs/3Dpcb.png)

For my [Solder](https://solder.hackclub.com) project, I decided to make a keychain that has LEDs arranged into the Hack Club "h" logo. The LEDs turn on when it gets dark, and turn off when it's light, using a photoresistor. The design also features a button controller vibration motor for maximum fidgeting ability.

## Parts List
- 1x PCB
- 6x LEDs
- 6x 220Ω resistors
